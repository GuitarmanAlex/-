quantization of charge

The electric charges we find in nature come in units of one magnitude
only, equal to the amount of charge carried by a single electron. We
denote the magnitude of that charge by e. (When we are paying attention to sign, we write −e for the charge on the electron itself.) We have
already noted that the positron carries precisely that amount of charge,
as it must if charge is to be conserved when an electron and a positron
annihilate, leaving nothing but light. What seems more remarkable is the
apparently exact equality of the charges carried by all other charged particles – the equality, for instance, of the positive charge on the proton and
the negative charge on the electron.
